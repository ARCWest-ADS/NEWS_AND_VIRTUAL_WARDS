Run scripts sequentially.
The "0 Sumtable ado" file is a Stata ado file which is required to create the tables in the "2 Tables" do file. It can either be added to the relevant ado folder on your PC and then used like a normal Stata command, or run as a program file each time before creating the tables using the "2 Tables" do file.
